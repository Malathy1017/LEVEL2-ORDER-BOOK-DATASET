# LEVEL2-ORDER-BOOK-DATASET
This dataset is a realistic synthetic Level 2 order book dataset, derived from actual NSE historical trading data from 10 November 2020, and expanded to 10-millisecond resolution using empirically validated market microstructure models. It is designed to replicate high-frequency trading behavior and spoofing attack patterns observed in real financial markets, while ensuring reproducibility and safety for academic experimentation.
While proprietary tick-by-tick Level 2 data is restricted due to exchange confidentiality, our synthetic dataset retains the statistical characteristics of real markets through careful generation grounded in historical prices, order flow imbalances, depth distribution patterns, and cancellation behaviors consistent with regulatory enforcement case studies.
